#Knack Pack Problem 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Knapsack Problem, is a classic optimization problem. In which you are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and you need to determine the best combination of items to include in a knapsack, given a weight constraint, in order to maximize the total value. Your code seems to be implementing a randomized algorithm to solve a version of this problem, where you are looking for a feasible solution within a certain number of iterations.
